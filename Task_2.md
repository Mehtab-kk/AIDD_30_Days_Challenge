# **🌐 AI-Driven Development — 30-Day Challenge**

## 📝 Task 2

# **📁Part A — Theory (Short Questions)**

## 1. Nine Pillars Understanding

### Q.1: Why is using AI Development Agents (like Gemini CLI) for repetitive setup tasks better for your growth as a system architect?

**answer**:  Agher AI apka sara repeat wala kam kerlega to app free raho ge app ka time save rahe ga to bari soch ker sakte hain ke 
abh designing ,planning aur setup kese kerna boht hi kam waqat me.


**Example**: app ka chai ka hotel hain aur app yeh kam repeat kerte ho jese:

* pani garm kerna
* Doodh ubalna
* chini pati dalna
* bartan dhona

**Ager app iss kam ke koi helper rakhdo to app ka kam asan ho jae ga
  to AI bhi app ka helper hi ha**


### Q.2: Explain how the Nine Pillars of AIDD help a developer grow into an M-Shaped Developer.

**answer**: first **M_Shaped Developer**  asa developer jisko multipe skills ati ho jese (AI, codding,tools,etc)
Now **nine pillar in AIDD** inn pillars ki wajah se ham coding me expert ha hame coding asan lagti ha .
ninie pillars ki help se developer multiple skills me expert ho jata hain jis M_shaped developer kehte hain.

## 2. Vibe Coding vs Specification-Driven Development

### Q.1: Why does Vibe Coding usually create problems after one week?

**answer**: 1. vibe coding me app ki koi planning nahi hoti
2. vibe coding me app sahi se structure define nahi kerte.
3. vibe coding app koi problem solve nahi kerte just fun kerte hain .

yahi kuch wajah ha ke app vibe coding hafte baad problem create kerte hain.

### Q.2: How would Specification-Driven Development prevent those problems?

**answer**: Specification-Driven development me pehle se plan kerte hain ke kese kam kerna hain kam me kiya hona chaye
aur sahi se structure define hoti hain ke iss way se kam kerna ha to iss wajah se vibe coding me masla hota hain aur
specification-driven development me hamara kam save rehta hain.

## 3. Architecture Thinking

### Q.1: How does architecture-first thinking change the role of a developer in AIDD

**answer**: Architecture-first  iss tecnique se develpoer coding ka kam nahi kerta wo  system me designinig ,planning 
aur AI ko guide kerta ha .

### Q.2: Explain why developers must think in layers and systems instead of raw code.
**answer**: Raw code yeh chota part hota hain iss liye iss itni tawaja nahi de jati baqi layers aur system thinking se code organized ker 
sakte hain ,scalable aur easy manage hota hain

# 📁 Part B — Practical Task (Screenshot Required)

## prompt

### Input

> write a paragraph specification an email validatorthat checks the email "mehtabdeveloper8@gmail.com".it must for "@", varifya valid domain like .com ,checks typos
  loke "gamil `n gmail", and return clear error messages if valid

### Prompt

✦ The email validator will meticulously scrutinize the provided email address, "mehtabdeveloper8@gmail.com", to ensure its validity and catch common errors. It will
  first confirm the presence of a single "@" symbol, essential for separating the local part from the domain. Subsequently, it will verify that the domain includes a
  valid top-level domain (TLD) such as ".com". A crucial feature will be its ability to detect and flag common typographical errors, specifically identifying instances
  where "gamil" is used instead of "gmail". Should any validation rule be violated, the system will return a clear and descriptive error message, guiding the user to
  correct the specific issue.
